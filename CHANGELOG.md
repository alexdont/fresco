# Changelog

All notable changes to Fresco are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.1.6 — 2026-05-15

Documentation + test polish patch. No changes to the rendered output
of `Fresco.viewer/1` — every existing call site behaves exactly as
in 0.1.5. The goal is to make Fresco's genericity (works for any
Phoenix app, not just daisyUI consumers) more visible to a new
reader, and to backfill render-assertion tests for the attributes
added in 0.1.4 / 0.1.5.

### Changed

- README: clarified that the daisyUI mapping for `theme={:inherit}`
  is one example among many — any CSS custom properties or fixed
  colors work. Added a second bare-color example so readers don't
  infer that daisyUI is required.
- README: surfaced the `theme={:system}` dark-mode default that
  landed in 0.1.4 with a "Heads up" callout in the Theming section,
  so consumers upgrading from 0.1.3 aren't caught off guard by
  viewers rendering dark on dark-OS machines.
- README: documented the `FrescoViewer` hook name explicitly so
  consumers maintaining an explicit hooks map (rather than spreading
  `window.FrescoHooks`) know what key to register.
- README: promoted the first-source-only caveat for
  `handle.imageToScreen` / `screenToImage` to a visible `⚠️ Caveat`
  callout in the multi-image section, with one extra sentence on
  what extension authors should do until multi-image disambiguation
  ships.
- README + viewer attr doc: rotation section now says "fifth button"
  (the row of four built-in buttons + a fifth opt-in rotation
  button) instead of "fifth icon".
- `priv/static/fresco.js`: documented the rationale for pinning
  OpenSeadragon to `4.1.0` so future maintainers know the bump
  contract.

### Tests

- Added render-assertion coverage for `:theme` (all four values),
  `:sources` (multi-image JSON payload), `:infinite_canvas`
  (modifier class + data attribute), `:rotate` (data attribute), and
  the `ArgumentError` guard that fires when neither `:src` nor
  `:sources` is provided.

## 0.1.5 — 2026-05-15

One additive feature — a fourth `:theme` value, `:inherit`, that lets
the parent app drive Fresco's palette via the existing `--fresco-*`
CSS custom properties. Use it to wire the viewer to a parent theme
system (daisyUI, Tailwind, custom palettes) so background, dot grid,
and nav buttons follow the parent theme as it changes. Fully
backwards compatible — existing `:system`/`:light`/`:dark` viewers
behave exactly as in 0.1.4.

### Added

- New `:inherit` value on `Fresco.viewer`'s `:theme` attribute. When
  set, Fresco emits `data-fresco-theme="inherit"` on the host div
  and **skips its own var declarations** for that viewer — the six
  `--fresco-*` properties stay unset until the parent app's CSS
  defines them. Pair with a CSS rule on
  `.fresco-viewer[data-fresco-theme="inherit"]` mapping the
  variables to the parent's theme tokens. The structural styles
  (background-color + dot grid pattern) still apply; only the color
  values come from the parent.

### Changed

- The base `.fresco-viewer { --fresco-bg: …; … }` rule is now scoped
  to `.fresco-viewer:not([data-fresco-theme="inherit"])` so it
  doesn't fight the parent's vars. The `@media (prefers-color-scheme:
  dark)` branch picks up the same `:not()` exclusion. Visible only
  to consumers who pass `theme={:inherit}`; everything else stays
  the same.

## 0.1.4 — 2026-05-14

Three additive features — opt-in 90° rotation, multi-image canvas
layout, and light/dark/system theming. The API surface stays
backwards-compatible (all existing attrs unchanged, all new attrs
have defaults), but the new `:theme` defaults to `:system`, which
means viewers on dark-OS machines will now follow
`prefers-color-scheme` and render dark by default. Pass
`theme={:light}` to lock to the old always-light look.

### Added

- New `:rotate` attribute on `Fresco.viewer` (defaults to `false`).
  When `true`, appends a 90°-clockwise rotation button between the
  Fullscreen and Zoom-in icons. Rotation is tracked independently
  of zoom/pan — "Reset view" deliberately doesn't undo it.
- New `:sources` attribute for laying multiple images out on one
  canvas. Each entry is a `%{src, x, y, width}` map in viewport
  units; the first image conventionally anchors the layout at
  `width: 1`, so `x: 1.1` puts the next image just to the right.
  Heights derive from each image's natural aspect ratio. Each
  entry's `src` runs through the same source-provider chain as
  `:src`, so plain images and DZI tile pyramids (via Tessera) can
  be mixed on a single viewer. Live re-renders that change the
  list re-open the viewer while preserving the current zoom/pan.
- `:src` is now optional. At least one of `:src` or `:sources`
  must be given; the component raises otherwise. Existing
  single-image callers keep working unchanged.
- New `:theme` attribute — `:system` (default), `:light`, or
  `:dark`. Plumbed to `data-fresco-theme` on the host div.
  `:system` follows the OS via `prefers-color-scheme`; the other
  two force a fixed palette regardless of OS preference.
- Six CSS custom properties on `.fresco-viewer` expose the entire
  palette surface: `--fresco-bg`, `--fresco-grid-dot`,
  `--fresco-nav-bg`, `--fresco-nav-bg-hover`, `--fresco-nav-fg`,
  `--fresco-nav-focus`. Override them in user CSS to wire fresco
  to a parent theme system (daisyUI, Tailwind, custom palettes) —
  README has a daisyUI mapping example.

### Changed

- Default viewer rendering follows `prefers-color-scheme` (`:theme`
  defaults to `:system`). Viewers on dark-OS machines that
  previously rendered light will now render dark unless explicitly
  pinned via `theme={:light}` or an inherited explicit theme.
- `handle.imageToScreen` / `handle.screenToImage` continue to
  operate on the first source when multiple are present.
  Multi-image coordinate disambiguation is planned but not yet
  implemented.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-05-14

Opt-in infinite-canvas mode + a default dot-grid background. No
breaking changes — every existing viewer keeps the stock clamped
behavior unless `infinite_canvas` is explicitly set, and the
grid is invisible by default (OSD's canvas paints over it).

### Added

- New `:infinite_canvas` attribute on `Fresco.viewer` (defaults to
  `false`). When `true`:
  - `visibilityRatio` drops to `0` and `constrainDuringPan` flips
    to `false`, so the user can pan freely beyond the image edges.
  - `minZoomImageRatio` lowers to `0.05` so the image can shrink
    to a thumbnail in the middle of a vast canvas.
  - The void around the image lights up with the dot-grid
    background (see below); the host also picks up a
    `.fresco-viewer--infinite` modifier class for any
    infinite-only styling consumers want to add.
- Subtle 24×24px dot-grid background on every Fresco viewer (via
  the new `.fresco-viewer` base class on the host div). Hidden by
  default because OSD's canvas paints over it; visible in the
  void when `infinite_canvas` is on, or behind transparent /
  padded images. Override `.fresco-viewer` in your own CSS for
  dark mode or a different accent.
- Documented future API: a planned `:sources` attribute will
  accept a list of `[%{src: "...", offset: {x, y}}]` for
  multiple images on the same canvas. The current `:src` stays
  as the single-image shortcut — no migration when `:sources`
  ships.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-05-14

Small UX + extension-API patch release. No breaking changes for
existing consumers; the click-to-zoom default flip is documented
below because it's user-visible.

### Added

- `handle.appendNavButton(...)`'s returned remover now carries
  `.setIcon(svgString)`, `.setTitle(text)`, and `.el` (the underlying
  `<button>` element). Extensions can mutate a button after creation
  without re-adding it (which would reshuffle its position in the
  nav column). Used by [Etcher](https://hex.pm/packages/etcher)
  0.2's visibility toggle to flip eye ↔ eye-slash.

### Changed

- Mouse single-click no longer zooms. `gestureSettingsMouse.clickToZoom`
  defaults to `false`; `dblClickToZoom`, scroll-to-zoom, and
  pinch-to-zoom on touch are unchanged. Single clicks now reliably
  pass through to overlays that want them (e.g. annotation selection)
  instead of fighting OSD's built-in click-to-zoom.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-12

Small additive release for layered libraries. No breaking changes.

### Added

- `handle.appendNavButton(svg, title, onClick)` — extensions append a
  button to the same `.fresco-nav` flexbox column that holds the
  built-in zoom-in / zoom-out / reset / fullscreen. Returns an
  unsubscribe function that removes the button on cleanup. Used by
  [Etcher](https://hex.pm/packages/etcher) to add a pencil button
  that toggles annotation mode.
- `animation` and `update-viewport` events bridged on the viewer
  handle (`handle.on("animation", fn)`). The existing `zoom` / `pan`
  events only fire on the *intent* of an input; the new ones fire
  on every spring-interpolated frame so overlays glide with the
  image instead of jumping at endpoints.

### Changed

- `<Fresco.viewer>` now sets `phx-update="ignore"` on its host div.
  Without it, LiveView morphdom patches walk the viewer's children
  on every render and wipe OSD's runtime-added canvas + extension
  overlays. The hook still receives `updated` callbacks for
  attribute changes (e.g. `data-src` swaps continue to work) —
  `phx-update` protects children only.
- Nav column reordered top-to-bottom: fullscreen → zoom-in → zoom-out
  → reset. Extensions appending via `handle.appendNavButton` land at
  the bottom of the column.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-12

Initial release. Polished pan-zoom image viewer for Phoenix apps, with a
deliberate extension surface for layered libraries.

### Built-in viewer

- `<Fresco.viewer id src class>` LiveView function component
- Pan: click-drag, touch-drag, keyboard arrows
- Zoom: mouse wheel, pinch, double-click, dedicated buttons, `+` / `-` keys
- Fit-to-view initial state regardless of image / container aspect ratio
- Heroicons nav overlay at top-left: zoom-in, zoom-out, reset, fullscreen
- Viewport clamped so the image can't be panned off-screen
  (`visibilityRatio: 1.0`, `constrainDuringPan: true`)
- Smooth animations tuned for snappy responsiveness
  (`animationTime: 0.3`, `springStiffness: 10`)
- Browser fullscreen mode

### Extension surface

- `window.Fresco.viewerFor(domId)` — synchronous lookup of a live viewer handle
- `window.Fresco.onViewerReady(domId, callback)` — async-safe lookup that fires
  the callback as soon as the viewer is ready (handles mount-order races
  when an extension hook mounts before its host viewer)
- `window.Fresco.registerSourceProvider(predicate, factory)` — registers a
  predicate-matched URL transformer; first registered provider that matches
  wins, falling back to a default plain-image provider
- Viewer handle exposes: `imageToScreen` / `screenToImage`,
  `getViewportBounds`, `fitBounds`, `setSource`,
  `swapSourcePreservingBounds`, and `on(event, handler)` for `zoom` / `pan`
  / `open` / `resize` events

### JS engine

- OpenSeadragon ~> 4.1 lazy-loaded from jsDelivr on first mount
- One bundled JS file (`priv/static/fresco.js`); no npm dep, no build step
  in consumer apps
- Heroicons SVGs inlined; no PNG sprite dance against a CDN

### Requirements

- `phoenix_live_view ~> 1.1`, `phoenix_html ~> 4.0`, `jason ~> 1.4`
